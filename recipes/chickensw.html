    <ul>
        <li>3 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>⅔ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>

        <li>¼ cup canola oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

        Steps
    </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice each chicken breast horizontally into 2 thin fillets. Place 6 fillets in a resealable zip-top bag with buttermilk, 1 tablespoon Buffalo sauce, and garlic powder. Seal the bag and shake to blend ingredients and evenly coat the chicken. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine flour, poultry seasoning, and pepper in a shallow dish or pie plate. Blend with a fork or whisk.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Dip chicken in the breading mixture until well and evenly coated on both sides. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Add enough oil to a large skillet so that it thickly coats the bottom and heat over medium-high heat until sizzling but not smoking. Place 2 chicken fillets in the skillet so they fit comfortably; do not overcrowd. Fry until crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain chicken on paper towels and repeat twice, adding more oil as necessary, to fry remaining chicken. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet.</li>
    </ol>
